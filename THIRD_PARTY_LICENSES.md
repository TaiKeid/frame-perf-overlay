## Used at run time from the Steam Frame, not bundled

The release tarball contains only the frame-perf-overlay program, its install script, the files in
`contrib/` and the documentation. The libraries and the font below are **not** included. The program
links to or reads the copies that are already on the Steam Frame (SteamOS and SteamVR).

The direct library dependencies below were checked with `readelf -d` and `ldd` on the release binary
on a Steam Frame. Versions are the SteamOS packages on the headset at the time of checking
(2026-09-27) and will change with SteamOS updates.

cairo and FreeType in turn load other SteamOS libraries (for example pixman, libpng, zlib,
fontconfig, HarfBuzz and the X11/XCB client libraries). Those also come from SteamOS and are not
bundled either.

These libraries are used only as shared libraries loaded at run time from the Steam Frame, so they
can be replaced with any compatible version. The text of the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1,
which covers cairo, libnl and the GNU C Library, is included in [`licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt`](licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt).

Portions of this software are based in part on the work of the FreeType Team (https://freetype.org).

## Icons and images

The launcher icons in `contrib/icons/` and the screenshots in `docs/images/` were drawn by this
program itself with cairo. They are original work of this project and fall under its MIT License.
